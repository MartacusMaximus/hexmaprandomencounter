  omens:
  - 'A Seer, beloved by her village, now trapped, inert in ironwood. Only the

    Fearmonger
    can break their binds.'
  - 'A winding path beneath blue songbirds. They sing so fiercely that some lie breathless
    on the ground. The winding

    path leads to a distant forest Hex.'
  - 'The mother tree. Six woodland guardians attack anybody who looks upon it. Foxes,

    wolves,
    and wildcats fight as one.'
  - 'The Fearmonger in horrific form, parts of owl, boar, and mouse. Lurking in the

    mist,
    they hurl a thorn spear (d10 hefty, cannot be taken from the Forest) before retreating
    to the branches.'
  - 'A circle of blackened tree stumps. Inside, metal weapons roar with burning heat
    unless dropped. Then come the three great guardians: stag, boar, and bear. The

    Fearmonger
    preys from within the mist.'
  - 'The Fearmonger shows their true, terrible form as live, writhing wood. If they
    cannot be subdued the Forest bursts forth into

    the rest of the Realm.'
