  omens:
  - Weeping huntsman, cursing everyone. Looking for his lost bloodhound who tended
    to him during injury.
  - A lost lad, full of stories. Claims a little old man called him into the woods.
  - Oppressive branches, tripping roots. A cloaked old man calls out, lost. If alerted
    he cries out just before he is dragged into the ground, taken to the lost realm.
  - The lost pets are running wild. If spotted they immediately run back toward the
    secret door to the lost realm. One drops a strange metallic bone, repellent to
    birds.
  - A dark clearing. Any deals made here are bound by fate. The Goblin offers a trade.
    A valuable lost thing in return for a favour he can call in later.
  - Suddenly dragged to the realm of lost things. Tunnels under piles of bric-a-brac.
    The Goblin gloats from atop his pile. Freedom is only granted for a binding favour,
    which the Goblin will enforce.
