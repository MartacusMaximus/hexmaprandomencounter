    until taken seriously."
  - "Under Seer\u2019s orders, a graveyard is being burned as a precaution against
    the restless dead. Acolytes scatter dried\nherbs. Five great red vultures circle."

    tree by

    a steel rope of impossible construction.'

    defenceless travellers. The travellers are artisans, known for their ability

    marching on the nearest Holding.
