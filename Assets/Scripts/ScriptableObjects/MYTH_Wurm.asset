  omens:
  - 'A leech-collector weeps. In a nearby swamp the colossal thing snatched her sister
    away with a bite. That bone-

    grinding noise haunts her.'
  - "An argumentative sage complains. The balance of nature has been tipped. The
    birds aren\u2019t behaving correctly and\nthere\u2019s not enough prey in the
    woods."
  - "A logging camp, crushed. Barrels of limeweed, a pungent appetite suppressor,
    left untouched. A Wurmshield surveys their master\u2019s work with unearned pride."
  - 'A stinking grey salt-bog. Grinding laughter can be heard on the wind as the
    Wurm sleeps below, dreaming of the next feast. Two Wurmshields keep watch,

    arguing
    over who is more loyal.'
  - 'The Wurm lounges on smashed burial mounds of Seers. It speaks with four

    Wurmshields,
    loyal but poor company.'
  - 'The Wurm bursts from the ground, giving

    one opportunity for stimulating
    conversation before its great feast begins.

    It will not stop until bloated
    or dead.'
