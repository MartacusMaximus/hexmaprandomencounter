  omens:
  - 'Nothing more than the hollow grunts of moon toads in the roots. When the Knights
    sleep they share a dream of a

    great eye sprouting from the ground.'
  - "An elderly tanner has been banished from her home for sowing discord. She dreamt
    embarrassing truths about her\nneighbours and couldn\u2019t resist sharing."
  - 'Grey birds watch from the branches. When scattered they flutter about in a

    spiralling
    circle before dispersing.'
  - 'Five acolytes march toward the nearest settlement. They aim to tear down walls

    so
    that all can be revealed to the Eye.'
  - 'A parade of dozens of acolytes, wheeling a wooden wagon carrying a boulder painted
    with a spiral eye. It is a peaceful parade,

    but they warn the ascent is
    coming.'
  - 'A rumbling below, then the Eye rises from the earth. Acolytes run to be near.
    It sprouts legs and begins to march toward the nearest Seer, aiming to devour
    them for their knowledge before returning to

    the earth.'
