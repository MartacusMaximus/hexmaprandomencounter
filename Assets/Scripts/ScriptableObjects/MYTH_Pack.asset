  omens:
  - 'Wailing shepherd. His sheepdogs have slaughtered their flock and fled. Crows

    feast
    on the gore. His family are hungry.'
  - "A band of poets and scribes fight among themselves, unable to speak except snarling
    growls. The Pack watch from a nearby hill, scattering if disturbed. When\nthey
    leave, the wanderers\u2019 voices return."
  - 'A rival fighting the leader. 6 wolves guard against interruption. They favour
    the challenger. The leader is toying with him

    and tears his throat when
    he gets bored.'
  - 'The wind suddenly stops, then the sound of jaws lapping at air. Then the howl,
    rough and screeching. Countless howls join the call, air completely still. Soon
    the

    howl stops and the wind returns.'
  - 'An important trade road has been blockaded by savagely torn trees and

    heaps
    of soil wet with blood.'
  - 'The 13 wolf pack howls in their den, setting their sights on a nearby Dwelling
    or Holding, attacking the humans and

    their broken beasts in dark or mist.'
