  mythName: TROLL
  omens:
  - In an itchy marsh, a severed, rubbery arm pulls itself along. Claws at anybody
    that interferes. Has no sense of direction, eventually withering to dense, dead
    flesh.
  - 'A tiny chameleon watches from a crooked branch. Hisses a warning if anybody
    passes near, stirring the Troll in the

    nearby trees, fleeing back to its
    home.'
  - 'A burglar is fleeing from an abandoned cave, a home carved into the earth. Clumsy
    furniture cobbled from rock and mud. Blood on the ground, smashed bones, another
    dead troll limb. The

    burglar found nothing of value in there.'
  - The Troll drags a dying warhorse back toward its new cave. A Knight lays dead.
  - 'Bronze, shimmering pond amongst a bog of fly-infested reeds. Disturbing the
    water grants a vision of the Troll being attacked

    by soldiers with axes,
    hacking the

    creature to bits.'
  - 'Split from head to pelvis, the Troll holds itself together as it rampages, craving

    meat
    to aid the regeneration.'
